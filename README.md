# Go Concept

# Arcitecture

I apply [Clean Architecture](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) for any project including my Go projects.
The main reason why use this architecture is to achieve [the separation of concerns](https://deviq.com/principles/separation-of-concerns). The general idea is that we should separate different concerns (e.g., Domain, UI, Application and so on) into its corresponding layer to establish well-organized systems. It has the following benefits:

- __testability__: easy to test each component/concern
- __independence__: easy to replace a component with a new one including external/internal dependencies (e.g., DB, Web Framework, any external API)
- __decouping__: reduce regression errors if one of the component/concern need to be changed. 



## Commands

- __go mod vendor__: copies of all packages needed to support builds and tests of packages in the main module in the /vendor folder.
